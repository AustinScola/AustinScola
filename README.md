# Austin Scola

[Hello friend][1], my name is Austin Scola.

## About Me
- I'm a [Bostonian][2].
- I ran competitively for around 10 years, but I am now _retired_ from running.
- I worked at [Boston Dynamics][3] for 2 years.
- I am now starting up a company.

## What I Am Working On

Currently, I am working on _solving_ software engineering. Let me explain:

First, let us examine that software engineering is a rather young field (around 80 years old). For comparison:

| Thing              | Orders of Magnitude Older than Software Engineering |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Human Civilization | 2                                                   |
| Homo Sapiens       | 5                                                   |
| Earth              | 8                                                   |

Because software engineering is so young, this leads me to believe that we have a large amount of head room for improvement. Specifically, we can improve how we create, read, update, delete, edit, test, lint, fuzz, transform, secure, document, version control, generate, collaborate on, plan, obfuscate, minimize, type check, fix code, and more.

So that is what I am working on.

Yes, it's a really broad goal. To start with, I am tackling one subset of that goal and will gradually expand the set.

The project occupying the majority of my waking hours right now is [Arborista][4]. Arborista is a tree transformation tool. It has many use cases but the initial use case that I am working on is code refactoring. It is freely available for installation on public GitHub repositories and currently supports Python 3 code. Try it out and let me know what you think!

The broad pursuit of _solving_ software engineering aligns with my policy for selecting actions for the state-machine that is life too.

## State-Machine Policy

If life is a state-machine, then currently, my policy for selecting actions applies a bias towards the following:
- larger higher derivates of change
- strategic risk embracement
- a simulated annealing style approach to the exploration vs. exploitation tradeoff
