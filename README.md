# Austin Scola

Hello friend [<sup>1</sup>](#1), my name is Austin Scola.

## About Me
- I'm a [Bostonian](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=bostonian+meaning).
- I ran competitively for around 10 years but I am now _retired_ from running
- I worked at Boston Dynamics for 2 years
- I am now starting up a company

## What I am working on

Currently, I am working on _solving_ software engineering. Let me explain:

First, let us examine that software engineering is a rather young field (around 80 years old). For
comparison:

| Thing              | Orders of Magnitude older than software engineering |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Human Civilization | 2                                                   |
| Homo Sapiens       | 5                                                   |
| Earth              | 8                                                   |

Because software engineering is so young, this leads me to believe that we have a large amount of
head room for improvement. Specifically, we can improve how we create, read, update, delete, edit,
test, lint, fuzz, transform, secure, document, version control, generate, collaborate on, plan,
obfuscate, minimize, type check, fix code, and more.

So that is what I am working on.

This pursuit aligns with my policy for selecting actions for the state-machine that is life too.

## State-Machine Policy

If life is a state-machine, my policy is to try to select actions which have larger higher derivates
of change and productive value. (Thought it is true that the number of derivates is somewhat bounded
by the finiteness of human life-spans and the ultimate heat death of the universe.)

When it comes to software engineering, software engineers can write code which massively helps
subsets of humans. While I find that amazing and enticing, the next derivative of that is to write
code which helps software engineers (and other humans) write code; that is what I aim to do.

This pursuit has the added benefit that the tools can be used to improve themselves. Let that sink
in for a second...

## Footnotes

<a class="anchor" id="1"></a>1. "Hello, friend" is a reference to the TV show _Mr. Robot_. These are
the first words spoken by the main character Elliot in the first episode. And the line itself is an
obvious reference to "Hello, World" programs.
