# Austin Scola

[Hello friend][1], my name is Austin Scola.

## About Me
- I'm a [Bostonian](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=bostonian+meaning).
- I ran competitively for around 10 years but I am now _retired_ from running.
- I worked at [Boston Dynamics](https://www.bostondynamics.com/) for 2 years.
- I am now starting up a company.

## What I am working on

Currently, I am working on _solving_ software engineering. Let me explain:

First, let us examine that software engineering is a rather young field (around 80 years old). For comparison:

| Thing              | Orders of Magnitude Older than Software Engineering |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Human Civilization | 2                                                   |
| Homo Sapiens       | 5                                                   |
| Earth              | 8                                                   |

Because software engineering is so young, this leads me to believe that we have a large amount of head room for improvement. Specifically, we can improve how we create, read, update, delete, edit, test, lint, fuzz, transform, secure, document, version control, generate, collaborate on, plan, obfuscate, minimize, type check, fix code, and more.

So that is what I am working on.

Yes, it's a really broad goal. So I am starting with one subset of it and will gradually expand the set. The specifics of the project occupying the majority of my waking hours I am not quite ready to share yet.

This broad pursuit aligns with my policy for selecting actions for the state-machine that is life too.

## State-Machine Policy

If life is a state-machine, then currently, my policy for action selection biases the following:
- larger higher derivates of change
- strategic risk embracement
- a simulated annealing style approach to balancing the exploration vs. exploitation tradeoff
