# Austin Scola

[Hello friend][1], my name is Austin Scola.

## About Me
- I'm a [Bostonian][2].

## State-Machine Policy

If life is a state-machine, then currently, my policy for selecting actions applies a bias towards the following:
- larger higher derivates of change
- strategic risk embracement
- a simulated annealing style approach to the exploration vs. exploitation tradeoff
